                <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">Scikit-learn</a>
                 is a popular open-source Python library for machine learning. One of the strengths of scikit-learn is its ease of use and well-defined API. This makes it a favorite tool among data scientists and machine learning practitioners. Thanks to its active community and continuous development, scikit-learn is constantly evolving and improving.
            </p>

            <p>
                At NVIDIA, we believe that investing in open-source projects like scikit-learn is important. Afterall, it is a central component of the modern data stack in both science and industry. By financially supporting the scikit-learn consortium, we are contributing to the long-term sustainability of scikit-learn and helping to ensure that it remains an easy to use, reliable and valuable tool for years to come. Furthermore, we hope to help advance the project&apos;s development, improve its performance, and enhance its capabilities for machine learning on GPUs.

                Our partnership with the scikit-learn consortium will also enable us to collaborate more closely with the scikit-learn community, and provide us with insights into how we can improve NVIDIA&apos;s <u>RAPIDS open-source libraries</u>  to better serve their needs. We are committed to working with the foundation to ensure that scikit-learn remains a powerful and easy to use machine learning library that meets the needs of data science practitioners in science and industry.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                NVIDIA&apos;s commitment to scikit-learn goes beyond financial support. We have hired <u>Tim Head</u>, an experienced open-source maintainer, to work full-time on the project. This is not  Tim&apos;s first open-source rodeo. He has previously contributed to several high-profile open-source projects, including Project Jupyter. His focus will be reviewing pull requests and coordinating the development of large features. Tim was recently elected as a core maintainer of scikit-learn. His expertise and experience will be invaluable in ensuring the continued growth and success of the project.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                In summary, NVIDIA&apos;s partnership with the scikit-learn consortium is an important step in our ongoing commitment to support the development and growth of open-source software in the machine learning community. We are excited to work with the foundation and the community of contributors to help advance the capabilities of scikit-learn and accelerate the development of machine learning applications.
